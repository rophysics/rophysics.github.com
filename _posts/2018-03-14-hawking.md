著名的物理学家和科普作家史蒂芬·霍金逝世，就在![equation][1]节这一天。因为运动神经元疾病（MND，motor neurone disease)ALS,霍金从22岁就开始被禁锢在自己的身体中，但是这并未成为他生命的巨大阻碍，他的生活非常丰富，研究、写书、讲座，参演电视节目、体验零重力，他说过，他的一生只有一个目标，那就是一个统一的宇宙理论，即宇宙从何而来，以及宇宙的未来。《霍金传》里，他的医生对他说，“因为神经元的信号无法传输给肌肉，你的肌肉会逐渐萎缩，即使像呼吸肌这样的自主神经元控制的肌肉，也会逐渐丧失功能”，“那么大脑呢？”年轻的霍金问医生，医生回答，“大脑完好无损”。这对霍金来说，是最大的好消息了。

[ABC][2]有一篇文章列举了他的很多Quotes，觉得很好，学习到很多他自己对世界的观察，列举如下。

> We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the universe. That makes us something very special.

Elon musk也说过类似的话，对于一只猴子来说，我们可以把火箭推上天，将人送到月球，对宇宙有如此的深刻认识，应该算不错了。

> Life would be tragic if it weren't funny.

反过来说，一件事如果你自己不觉得有趣，就无法坚持做完，如果这个项目旷日持久，是很难坚持下去了的，取得很大成就的人，往往对所做的事情充满了热情，辛苦但不痛苦。

> The great enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge. 

不要害怕说“我不知道”，而是要对“我知道了”保持谨慎，知识无涯，不要停下学习的脚步。

> For millions of years, mankind lived just like the animals. Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination. We learned to talk and we learned to listen. Speech has allowed the communication of ideas, enabling human beings to work together to build the impossible. Mankind's greatest achievements have come about by talking, and it's greatest failures by not talking. It doesn't have to be like this. Our greatest hopes could become reality in the future. With the technology at our disposal, the possibilities are unbounded. All we need to do is make sure we keep talking.

> My goal is simple. It is a complete understanding of the universe, why it is as it is and why it exists at all.

> I believe the simplest explanation is, there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realization that there probably is no heaven and no afterlife either. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe and for that, I am extremely grateful.

> If aliens ever visit us, I think the outcome would be much ad when Christopher Columbus first landed in America, which didn't turn out very well for the Native Americans.

对于外星人造访地球的看法，无异于美洲原住民见到哥伦布的船队。

> We are in danger of destroying ourselves by our greed and stupidity. We cannot remain looking inwards at ourselves on a small and increasingly polluted and overcrowded planet.

> My disabilities have not been a significant handicap in my field, which is theorectical physics. Indeed, they have helped me in a way by shielding me from leturing and administrative work that i would otherwise have been involved in. I have managed, however, only because of the large amount of help I have received from my wife, children, colleagues and students. I find that people in general are very ready to help, but you should encourage them to feel that their efforts to aid you are worthwhile by doing as well as you possibly can.

生活中无时不刻需要别人的援手，你的行为应该让别人对你的帮助变得值得。

> Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist.Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up.

> Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change. 

智力是一种适应变化的能力。懂得多不意味着智力高，因为懂得多只是意味着记得东西多，计算机不是谁的硬盘大就好。只有不变的东西才需要记忆，变化的东西无法记忆，只能做分析和行动，就是适应能力——分析当前状态和应对策略，并执行。

> We are all different, but we share the same human spirit.

> My advice to other disabled people would be, concentrate on things your disability doesn't prevent you doing well, and don't regret the things it interferes with. Don't be disabled in spirit, as well as physically.

> So next time someone complains that you have made a mistake, tell him that may be a good thing. Because without imperfection, neither you nor I would exist.

BBC也列举了很多：

On Black holes:
> Einstein was wrong when he said'God does not play dice'. Consideration of black holes suggests, not only that God does play dice, but that he somethimes confuses us by throwing them where they can't be seen.

On life:
> One, remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Two, never give up work. Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it. Three, if you are lucky enough to find love, remember it is there and don't throw it away.

On commercial success:
> I want my books sold on airport bookstalls.

On God:
> It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going.

On euthanasia:
> The victim should have the right to end his life, if he wants. But I think it would be a great mistake. However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. While there's life, there is hope.

On Artificial Intelligence:
> The development of full artifical intelligence could spell the end of the human race. It would take off on its own, and redesign itself at an ever increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete, and would be superseded.

On fame:
> The downside of my celebrity is that I cannot go anywhere in the world without beiing recognised. It is not enough for me to wear dark sunglasses and a wig. The wheelchair gives me away.

On the possibility of contace between humans and aliens:
> I think it would be a disaster. The extraterrestrials would probably be far in advance of us. The history of advanced races meeting more primitive people on this planet is not very happy, and they were the same species. I think we should keep our heads low.

On Space Colonies:
> I don't think the human race will survive the next 1000 years, unless we spread into space, There are too many accidents that can be befail life on a sigle planet. But I'm an optimist. We will reach out to the stars.

On being diagnosed with motor neurone disease:
> My expectations were reduced to zero when I was 21. Everything since then has been a bonus.

On death:
> I have lived with the prospect of an early death for the last 49 years. I'm not afraid of death, but I'm in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first.

####Update:

霍金2008年在[TED][3]上有一个演讲《Questioning the universe》，也值得一看：

<div style="max-width:854px"><div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%"><iframe src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/lang/en/stephen_hawking_asks_big_questions_about_the_universe" width="854" height="480" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>

There is nothing bigger or older than the universe. The questions I would like to talk about are: one, where did we come from? How did the universe come into being? Are we alone in the universe? Is there alien life out there? What is the future of the human race?

Up until the 1920s, everyone thought the universe was essentially static and unchanging in time. Then it was discoverd that the universe was expanding. Distant galaxies were moving away from us. This meant they must have been closer together in the past. If we extrapolate back, we find we must have all been on top of each other abouth 15 billion years ago. This was the Big Bang, the begining of the universe.

But was there anything before the Big Bang? If not, what created the universe? Why did the universe emerge from the Big Bang the way it did? We used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts. First, there were the laws like Maxwell's equations and general relativity that determined the evolution of the universe, given its state over all of space at one time. And second, there was no question of the inital state of the universe.

We have made good progress on the first part, and now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions. But until recently, we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe. However, this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct. Under extreme conditions, general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like dimension of space. This removes the distinction between time and space, and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state. The universe can spontaneously create itself out of nothing.

Moreover, we can calculate a probability that the universe was created in different states. These predictions are in excellent agreement with observations by the WMAP satellite of the cosmic microwave background, which is an imprint of the very early universe. We think we have solved the mystery of creation. Maybe we should patent the universe and charge everyone royalties for their existence.

I now turn to the second big question: are we alone, or is there other life in the universe? We believe that life arose spontaneously on the Earth, so it must be possible for life to appear on other suitable planets, of which there seem to ba a large number in the galaxy.

But we don't know how life first appeared. We have two pieces of observational evidence on the probability of life appearing. The first is that we have fossils of algae from 3.5 billion years ago. The Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years. So life appeared on Earth within half a billion years of it being possible, which is short comopared to the 10-billion-year lifetime of a planet of Earth type. This suggests that the probability of life appearing is reasonably high. If it was very low, one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available.

On the other hand, we don't seem to have been visited by aliens. I am discounting the reports of UFOs. Why would they appear only to cranks and weirdos? If there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports and keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring, it seems to have been a sigularly ineffective policy so far. Furthermore, despite an extensive search by SETI projects, we haven't heard any alien civilizations at our stage of development within a radius of a few hundred light years. Issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet.

The brings me to the last of the big questions: the future of the human race. If we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy, we should make sure we survive and continue. But we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history. Our population and our use of the finit resources of planet Earth are growing exponentially, along with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill. But our genetic code still carries the selfish and aggressive instincts that were of survival advantage in the past. It will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years, let alone the next thousand or million.

Out only chance of long-term survival is not to remain inward-looking on planet Earth, but to spread out into space. The answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years. But if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years, our future is in space. That is why I am in favor of manned -- or should I say, personned space flight.

All of my life I have sought to understand the universe and find answers to these questions. I have been very lucky that my disability has not been a serious handicap. Indeed, it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge. The ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe, and we are making good progress. Thank you for listening.
