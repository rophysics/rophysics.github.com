著名的物理学家和科普作家史蒂芬·霍金逝世，就在![equation][1]节这一天。因为运动神经元疾病（MND，motor neurone disease),霍金从22岁就开始被禁锢在自己的身体中，看过《万物理论》和BBC拍摄的《霍金传》，作为一个宇宙学家，身体的束缚不影响他仰望夜空，思考宇宙谜题。他的医生对他说，因为神经元的信号无法传输给肌肉，他的肌肉会逐渐萎缩，即使像呼吸肌这样的自主神经元控制的肌肉，也会逐渐丧失功能，那么大脑呢？年轻的霍金问医生，“大脑完好无损”，医生回答。

[ABC][2]有一篇文章列举了他的很多Quotes，觉得很好，学习到很多他自己对世界的观察，列举如下。

> We are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet of a very average star. But we can understand the universe. That makes us something very special.

Elon musk也说过类似的话，对于一只猴子来说，我们可以把火箭推上天，将人送到月球，对宇宙有如此的深刻认识，应该算不错了。

> Life would be tragic if it weren't funny.

反过来说，一件事如果你自己不觉得有趣，就无法坚持做完，如果这个项目旷日持久，是很难坚持下去了的，取得很大成就的人，往往对所做的事情充满了热情，辛苦但不痛苦。

> The great enemy of knowledge is not ignorance, it is the illusion of knowledge. 

不要害怕说“我不知道”，而是要对“我知道了”保持谨慎，知识无涯，不要停下学习的脚步。

> For millions of years, mankind lived just like the animals. Then something happened which unleashed the power of our imagination. We learned to talk and we learned to listen. Speech has allowed the communication of ideas, enabling human beings to work together to build the impossible. Mankind's greatest achievements have come about by talking, and it's greatest failures by not talking. It doesn't have to be like this. Our greatest hopes could become reality in the future. With the technology at our disposal, the possibilities are unbounded. All we need to do is make sure we keep talking.

> My goal is simple. It is a complete understanding of the universe, why it is as it is and why it exists at all.

> I believe the simplest explanation is, there is no God. No one created the universe and no one directs our fate. This leads me to a profound realization that there probably is no heaven and no afterlife either. We have this one life to appreciate the grand design of the universe and for that, I am extremely grateful.

> If aliens ever visit us, I think the outcome would be much ad when Christopher Columbus first landed in America, which didn't turn out very well for the Native Americans.

对于外星人造访地球的看法，无异于美洲原住民见到哥伦布的船队。

> We are in danger of destroying ourselves by our greed and stupidity. We cannot remain looking inwards at ourselves on a small and increasingly polluted and overcrowded planet.

> My disabilities have not been a significant handicap in my field, which is theorectical physics. Indeed, they have helped me in a way by shielding me from leturing and administrative work that i would otherwise have been involved in. I have managed, however, only because of the large amount of help I have received from my wife, children, colleagues and students. I find that people in general are very ready to help, but you should encourage them to feel that their efforts to aid you are worthwhile by doing as well as you possibly can.

生活中无时不刻需要别人的援手，你的行为应该让别人对你的帮助变得值得。

> Remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the universe exist.Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up.

> Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change. 

智力是一种适应变化的能力。懂得多不意味着智力高，因为懂得多只是意味着记得东西多，计算机不是谁的硬盘大就好。只有不变的东西才需要记忆，变化的东西无法记忆，只能做分析和行动，就是适应能力——分析当前状态和应对策略，并执行。

> We are all different, but we share the same human spirit.

> My advice to other disabled people would be, concentrate on things your disability doesn't prevent you doing well, and don't regret the things it interferes with. Don't be disabled in spirit, as well as physically.

> So next time someone complains that you have made a mistake, tell him that may be a good thing. Because without imperfection, neither you nor I would exist.

BBC也列举了很多：

On Black holes:
> Einstein was wrong when he said'God does not play dice'. Consideration of black holes suggests, not only that God does play dice, but that he somethimes confuses us by throwing them where they can't be seen.

On life:
> One, remember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Two, never give up work. Work gives you meaning and purpose and life is empty without it. Three, if you are lucky enough to find love, remember it is there and don't throw it away.

On commercial success:
> I want my books sold on airport bookstalls.

On God:
> It is not necessary to invoke God to light the blue touch paper and set the universe going.

On euthanasia:
> The victim should have the right to end his life, if he wants. But I think it would be a great mistake. However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. While there's life, there is hope.

On Artificial Intelligence:
> The development of full artifical intelligence could spell the end of the human race. It would take off on its own, and redesign itself at an ever increasing rate. Humans, who are limited by slow biological evolution, couldn't compete, and would be superseded.

On fame:
> The downside of my celebrity is that I cannot go anywhere in the world without beiing recognised. It is not enough for me to wear dark sunglasses and a wig. The wheelchair gives me away.

On the possibility of contace between humans and aliens:
> I think it would be a disaster. The extraterrestrials would probably be far in advance of us. The history of advanced races meeting more primitive people on this planet is not very happy, and they were the same species. I think we should keep our heads low.

On Space Colonies:
> I don't think the human race will survive the next 1000 years, unless we spread into space, There are too many accidents that can be befail life on a sigle planet. But I'm an optimist. We will reach out to the stars.

On being diagnosed with motor neurone disease:
> My expectations were reduced to zero when I was 21. Everything since then has been a bonus.

On death:
> I have lived with the prospect of an early death for the last 49 years. I'm not afraid of death, but I'm in no hurry to die. I have so much I want to do first.
